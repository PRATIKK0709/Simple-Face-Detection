# Face Detection and Visualization

## Introduction

This Python script uses OpenCV and a Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in an image and visualize the results. It draws rectangles around detected faces, displays the number of detected faces, and saves individual face images as separate files.

## Usage

1. **Installation**:
   - Ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed on your system.
   - Clone the repository:

     ```
     git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git
     cd YourRepositoryName
     ```

2. **Running the Script**:
   - Modify the `image_path` variable in the script to specify the path to the image you want to process.
   - Run the script:

     ```
     python face_detection.py
     ```

3. **Viewing Results**:
   - The script will display the input image with rectangles drawn around the detected faces.
   - It will also save individual face images as `face_0.jpg`, `face_1.jpg`, and so on.
   - To close the visualization window, press any key.
